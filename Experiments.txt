Experiments

2.3
Assume only one table schema:
100 attributes
Each attribute 10 bytes each
(So records are fixed length)

1. Calculate the size of fixed length serialization of records in the table
2. Use fixed_len_sizeof() to check if agrees with calculation


3.2
1. Plot performance (records/second) versus page 
size for read/write
2. Compare this to blocked disk I/O characteristics from tutorial
3. Discuss why page based format is superior to storing records using a CSV
4. Discuss short-comings of way we organize pages

4.2
1. Measure the performance of "csv2heapfile", comment on how the page size affects the performance of load

<Write "select" executable>

2. Measure the performance of query against page size
3. Comment on the choice of page size and the effects of the range from "start" and "end" on the performance of the query

5.2
1. Measure the performance of "csv2colstore" against different page sizes
2. Compare the result with that of "csv2heapfile" in the previous section. Comment on the difference.
3. Compare the performance of "select2" with that of "select" in the previous section. Comment on the difference.
4. Compare the performance of "select3" with that of "select" and "select2". Comment on the difference especially with respect to different selection ranges (different values of start and end)
